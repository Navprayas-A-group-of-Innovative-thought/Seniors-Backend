# Authorisation and Authentication Instructions


## 1. Sign Up

* From the frontend, request will be passed from the body as : 
```json
{
    "name" : "Ashutosh Krishna",
    "email" : "sekado1151@brosj.net",
    "password" : "Asdfghjkl1@",
    "confirmPassword" : "Asdfghjkl1@",
    "contact" : "9031XXXXXX",
    "college" : "IIT XYZ",
    "category" : "IIT",
    "batch" : "2022",
    "branch" : "CSE"
}
```

* All the fields will be validated as per the [validations](#validations).
* If the user already exists, error with status code of 400 will be sent to frontend with a message.
* The route for the signup will be {{URL}}**/api/signup**


## 2. Generating Link


* When the signup form is submitted, all the fields(except confirmPassword) are saved in the database. At this point, emailVerified is false and user cannot login.
* With that, email is passed as payload to JWT.
* JWT signs the payload with a secret key and creates an activation link which expires in next 30 minutes.
* A verification email with an activation link(generated by JWT) is sent to the client.

## 2. Account Activation

* The route for activation will be {{URL}}**/api/activation**.
* Once the user clicks on the email, JWT decodes the token and extracts the user email. 
* In addition to this, the emailVerified field in the database is also set to true and now user can sign in.
* If there is any error on the backend part, or the verification link expires(30 minutes), an error with status code of 401 will be sent to the frontend. In addition to this, the user details is cleared from the database.
* After account activation, if the user again clicks on the activation link within expiry time, a response of 200 with message **Already Verified** will be sent to frontend.

## 3. Log In

* From the frontend, request will be passed from the body as :

```json
{
    "email" : "lednor@mailpoof.com",
    "password" : "Asdfghjkl1@"
}
```
* The route will be {{URL}}**/api/login**
* The email and password will be validated against the [validations](#validations).
* Once validated successfully, the email is checked if it exists or not.
    * If it doesn't exist, an error with status code of 400 will be sent to frontend.
    * If it exists, the password is compared against the hashed password in the database.
        * If it doesn't match, an error with status code of 400 will be sent to frontend.
        * If it matches, the user is signed in and a token(expiring in 7 days) is generated.

## 4. Forgot Password

* From the frontend, request will be passed from the body as :

```json
{
    "email" : "sekado1151@brosj.net"
}
```
* The route will be {{URL}}**/password/forgot**
* The email is matched in the database. If there's no user, an error with status code of 400 will be sent to frontend.
* If user is found, a password reset link(expires in 10 min) is sent to the email of the user. 
* Also, the resetPasswordLink field in the database is updated with the token generated.

## 5. Reset Password

* The route is {{URL}}**/password/reset**
* Once the user clicks on the email, if it's expired or there is any error, an error with status code of 400 will be sent to frontend.
* If there is no error, the token is matched with the resetPasswordLink field in the user's database.
* If it matches, the following parameter is received from the frontend:
```json
{
    "newPassword" : "kuchhbhi1_"
}
```
* This password in the database is now updated with the newPassword(hashed) and resetPasswordLink is again made empty.
* If there's any error in updating the password, an error with status code of 400 will be sent to frontend.
